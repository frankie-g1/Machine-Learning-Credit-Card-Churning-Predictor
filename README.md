# CreditCardAttrition_DataScienceMachineLearning Summary
This is our project focused on prediction using a credit card dataset. We predicted if a customer would churn, how long they would stay with the company, and then created a recommender to help assign customers a credit card.

Future work for our project includes the deployment of our credit card recommender.

[FinalProject.ipynb](./FinalProject.ipynb) serves as the full report for this project. Included is a demographic study alongside our prediction models.
